Helper methods to get your data from Khan Academy

## The problem
Khan Academy [shut down their API](https://github.com/Khan/khan-api), leaving you wondering how you could continue
to keep your student data in sync between your LMS and Khan Academy.

#### This isn't...
This is not like the full Khan API. It is not meant for use in user facing environments.

#### This is..
If you need to get your data from Khan Academy using a backend service, this is for you.

## Setup
TODO: Make this a package

This is run on Node. It uses `axios` to log into Khan Academy, and stores the cookies with `tough-cookie` and `axios-cookiejar-support`. Once
authenticated, you should be able to get various data through the `/api/internal/graphql` endpoints.

I plan on making a package, but for now, you can get going by copying `index.js` and make sure you have
installed `axios`, `tough-cookie`, and `axios-cookiejar-support` with

```
npm i --save axios tough-cookie axios-cookiejar
```

## Usage
```javascript
// TODO: Update this line when made into a package
const { KhanApi } = require("./index.js") // or whatever you decide to name the file

const CREDS = {
  identifier: "your coach account",
  password: "your password",
}

const main = async () => {
  let kapi = new KhanApi()
  
  // always authenticate before retrieving data
  await kapi.authenticate(CREDS.identifier, CREDS.password)
  
  // now that we are authenticated, we can retrieve data. Let's get the coach data
  // with a helper method
  let data = await kapi.getCoach()
    .then((res) => res.data)
    .catch((err) => console.error(err))

  console.log({ data: JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) })
  
  // or inspect the network calls in Chrome dev tools while on Khan Academy to find
  // another endpoint, and use that. See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details
  
  let payload = {
    operationName: "getClassList",
    variables: {},
    query:
      "query getClassList {\n  coach {\n    id\n    joined\n    studentLists: coachedStudentLists {\n      name\n      id\n      cacheId\n      key\n      topics {\n        id\n        slug\n        title: translatedTitle\n        iconPath\n        domainSlug\n        learnableContentSummary {\n          countExercises\n          __typename\n        }\n        __typename\n      }\n      autoGenerated\n      countStudents\n      topicTitle\n      classroomDistrictInfo {\n        id\n        isNweaMapSynced\n        __typename\n      }\n      __typename\n    }\n    demoClassProgress {\n      completed\n      selectedTopics {\n        id\n        slug\n        __typename\n      }\n      __typename\n    }\n    __typename\n  }\n  user {\n    id\n    tosForFormalTeacherStatus\n    schoolAffiliation {\n      id\n      name\n      postalCode\n      location\n      __typename\n    }\n    affiliationCountryCode\n    __typename\n  }\n}\n",
  } 
  let customData = await kapi.getGraphQL("/getClassList", payload)
  
  console.log({customData})
}

main()
```

## Contributing
I would gladly welcome any contributers to this project. There are many GraphQL endpoints on Khan Academy, with some great data.
I would like to get some wrapper around those to make it easier to users to find
their students' data.

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for ideas on how you can help.
